--- Mine Field game with Assembly ---

Mine field games main idea is: Declaring all the locations without steping on a bomb.
We build up this project with static bomb locations on the field.
The field size is 5x6 (row x column) and there are 5 bombs on the field. If you can make 25 input without encounter the bombs 
you would finish the game succesfully.
